# WDI PROJECT 1

For this game, I combined the wonderful world of Star Wars with everyones favourite 56 year old British actor/comedian Martin Clunes. The game logic is simple; catch the falling Star Wars characters (played by Martin Clunes) and gain as many points as possible. If you miss one you lose a life and if you lose 3 lives you lose the game.

Using javascript and jQuery, I implemented collision detection in order to trigger various events on the falling of the elements that you needed to catch.

As well as the game functionality being well detailed and the code considerably refactored, I also wanted to make sure that from a user's perspective, it was fun to use, applying several different animations with CSS and jQuery and also used my skills in Adobe Photoshop to design assets myself.

The amount of fun I had making this game could not be understated. I saw this as my first opportunity on the course to get as creative as possible with my ideas and code so tried to build something that was original and yet still enjoyable to play.
